# Clock_me

# Description
# Author : Pattan Sandy Bockarie


This project is a simple digital clock implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and date dynamically, updating in real-time. The project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and JavaScript animations.

# Features

Digital Clock: Shows the current time in HH:MM:SS format.

Date Display: Displays the full date in a human-readable format.

Responsive Design: Ensures the clock looks good across different screen sizes.

# File Structure

digital_clock.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the clock.

digital_clock.css: Contains the styling for the digital clock.

digital_clock.js: Includes the logic for updating the clock in real-time.

# Setup and Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

# git clone https://github.com/PSandy833/Clock_me.git

Navigate to the project directory:

# cd digital_clock

Open digital_clock.html in any modern web browser to view the clock.

# How It Works

JavaScript retrieves the current time using new Date().

The setInterval function updates the time every second.

The time and date are formatted and displayed using the DOM.

# Dependencies

No external dependencies are required. The project uses only native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


# Customization

Modify digital_clock.css to change the appearance of the clock.
